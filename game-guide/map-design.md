# Map Design Considerations
## Intro
This is an archive of core concepts that should be considered when designing maps.  The estimated normal values may be totally useless depending on the context of the game and what you're trying to design.  They're just there to provide a ball park where balance may be found under average conditions.

Keep in mind that map design can easily offset or overpower the normal imbalances in game mechanics.  With action being turn limited the space between locations is the chief determinant of what efficient strategies are.  You should always watch the game play out on a map you designed.  There is much to be learned about what works well and under what conditions.

These maps are an artistic expression.  They should be made to explore the boundaries of what we know.  They should question accepted ideas and norms.  We should be seeking something new and exciting.  Only by exploring something new can we absorb what works and leave the rest behind. 

## The Universe Generator
While awesome at saving coding time the universe generator is terrible at mocking up ideas.  It's best to sketch things out on paper first.  Ideally you shouldn't open the universe generator until you have a good idea of galaxy layout and have rough designs of critical points on the map.  That way you set the galaxies up once and don't get cornered by not having enough of them.

## Critical Points
Pay close attention to these points.  They should probably be hand built or heavily tweaked.
* planet galaxies and the space around their warps - counts need to be kept similar and this is a great place to introduce tactical barriers/opportunities
* CA placement - the mines will stack up closest to the store selling them.  make sure that's not somewhere too disruptive.
* uno placement - access to repairs determines where mining can be sustained and where operations are feasible
* racial warps - these are often choke points that everyone needs to cross

## Critical Distances
These are where you want to sit down and count sectors.
* fed space to planet galaxies - smaller counts make it easier to attack planets from fed.  too close tends to cause mining near or in racial space and too far makes the game feel empty.  40ish sectors is a normal value.  20 is a meat grinder and 60 will feel distant.
* uno to planet - closer means easier to bust and harder to hold.  5-15 sector distances are common here.
* the number of minable sectors between an uno and planet is also of critical importance.  that determines the capacity for defensive mining.  1 minable sector per ship in the operation will allow for reasonable defense.
* CA to planet - closer means easier to mine and harder to clear.  5-15 sector distances are common here.
* weapon spacing/arming costs - the game runs on about 20 weapons being normally used and you can cover them with about 10 shops.  if you can hit what you need out of them inside of 30 turns people will be more inclined to play from fed.  if it's over 40 people will be looking for short cuts.

## Odds and Ends
* port density - this affects the balance between raiding and trading.  tightly packed ports tend to make routes worse and raiding easier.  too few ports overall tend to encourage razing and re-racing as a trolling tactic.  1-2 ports per 5 sectors is in the ball park but this is very circumstantial.
* it's best to allow the generator to randomly place as much as possible.  let the computer generate locations/warps/ports and then adjust the critical points by hand.  this reduces workload of creation and makes the result look less artificial.
* check the ports generated.  if there's a huge disparity between races then regenerate them.
* planet galaxies often play better with no substantial dead ends.  having two or three paths to attack or flee through forces tactical decisions to be made.
* planets are a burden on an alliance.  if you want safety you'll find it in fed.  and the mines you'll buy to protect them are far more costly than any turn savings from keeping guns.
* value is found in trade routes and position of strategic importance.  is there a perfect 5x route?  that's valuable territory.  is there a bottleneck warp that most people have to pass through?  that's also a valuable spot.  is the only CA in a minable position?  that may be advantageous to mine in.

## Basic Location Sets
Most of the time you can tick the following lists in the location generator and have a good outcome.
* for racial space: race HQ, backyard drone farm, bank, bar, and weapon shop
* for neutral space: UG HQ, tech shops, ship shops, weapon shops, uno/BYD, bank, bar, and occasionally a CA
* for planet space: empty is acceptable.  red planets need scanners.  bank/bar are commonly wanted.  uno/byd/ca sometimes will be here.  don't forget the planets.
* common weapon shops: Underground Weapons, Monastery of the Iron Maiden, Pulse of the Universe, No Shields Inc 2, No Shields Inc 1, Creonti Weapons 2, Creonti Weapons 1, Torpedo Outlet, The One-Stop-Weapons-Shop 3, Nijarin Weaponry
* common ship shops: Cross World Transit Ships, Huge Ship Central, Refurbished Ships, Ship-O-Rama
