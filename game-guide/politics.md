**Politics and the Ruling Council**

Politics and the Ruling Council are often the most overlooked aspect of SMR. Both play a crucial role though, determining the following:

* races you can trade with
* racial weapons you can use
* if racial beacons will protect you

Each racial ruling council is made up of the top five members of that race, ranked by experience. The President of each race is determined by alignment and experience. To become president, you must have the highest experience out of all the council members with alignment over 150. In the case of two council members having the same experience, the one who has the higher alignment will become president.

You can access your race's ruling council by clicking on the Politics link on the left-hand side of your screen. From there, you will be able to view who is on your ruling council. If you are a member of the council, you will be able to cast your vote for peace/war with other races, as well as increasing or decreasing global relations with another race by 15 each day. The president of the council is the only one who can call votes for war or peace. The president can also veto those votes.
