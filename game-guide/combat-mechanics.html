<h1>Combat Mechanics</h1>
<h4>How the Titillating Lasers Tickle</h4>
<p>Nearly always, when a question is ask about how combat in SMR works, the correct answer is “it depends”. &nbsp;Player level factors in to everything. &nbsp;Port and planet levels may also be key. &nbsp;How many connecting sectors there are might decide the fate of your ship. &nbsp;There's a maneuverability rating factor that changes depending how damaged your ship is.</p>
<h2>Hardpoint Weapons</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firing Weapons at Forces, Ports, or Planets</h3>
<p>Player Level Accuracy Modifier = alaMod = &nbsp;( level<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;/ 60 ) + ( level / 2 ) + 2</p>
<p>This modifier is important to all hardpoint weapons fire. &nbsp;It starts at 2.5% at level 1 and increases to 68.7% at level 50.</p>
<p>Ports, planets, and forces each have a different defensive modifier:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ports reduce accuracy by two points per port level. &nbsp;That's 2% at level 1 and 18% at level 9.</li>
  <li>Planets reduce accuracy by 0.286% per level. &nbsp;A level 45 planet costs us 12.9%.</li>
  <li>Forces have no defensive modifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these modifiers are multiplicative. &nbsp;In other words, the adjustments they make are proportionate to the accuracy of the weapon being fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firing Weapons at Ships</h3>
<p>Attacker Level Accuracy Modifier = alaMod = &nbsp;( level<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;/ 60 ) + ( level / 2 ) + 2</p>
<p>Defender Level Accuracy Modifier = dlaMod = [ ( level<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;/ 60 ) + ( level / 2 ) + 2 ] / 2</p>
<p>Ship MR Rating Modifier = mrMod = attMR - defMR</p>
<p>MR can only reduce weapon accuracy. &nbsp;Low single digit numbers penalties are common. &nbsp;Low double digits will happen under more extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Weighted Random</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Combat Drones</h2>
<p>Combat drones always fire last. &nbsp;This is unfortunate for two reasons: drones deal rollover damage, which is more valuable up front. &nbsp;And it is easier to find hardpoint weapons that deal armor damage. &nbsp;But they are still a valuable damage source, even if the order is not optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firing Drones at Forces, Ports, or Planets</h3>
<p>The algorithm that determines how many drones are launched is most simple when firing at environmental targets. &nbsp;Player level has no effect. &nbsp;There are no defensive modifiers. &nbsp;That simplicity makes it a good place to start. &nbsp;The equation looks like this:</p>
<p>Drones Launched = random(6 to 57)</p>
<p>The number of drones launched when attacking the environment is a percentage of the total alive on your ship. &nbsp;This is effectively a random number generated between 6% and 57%. &nbsp;On average, 31.5% of drones launch. &nbsp;They always hit. &nbsp;They always deal 2 damage. &nbsp;Given these facts, combat drones can be modeled as dealing 63 DPS per 100 drones alive at the time of firing. &nbsp;The variation is quite extreme, but eventually the law of large numbers will bring the average to 31.5%.</p>
<p>Now, a bit about where that 6-57% came from. &nbsp;A ship firing drones has, before modifiers, a 3% base accuracy. &nbsp;A random number is generated between 3 and 54. &nbsp;That random number is added to the base accuracy which gives us a minimum possible of 6 and a max possible of 57. &nbsp;Environmental targets have no offensive or defensive modifiers concerning combat drones. &nbsp;We press attack, we get somewhere between 6 and 57 percent launched, we deal between 12 and 114 damage per hundred drones. &nbsp;It's simple, boring damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firing Drones at Ships</h3>
<p>Players versus player combat is where drones get a little complicated. &nbsp;That 6 to 57% random is still the same. &nbsp;But now we have modifiers based on attacker level, defender level, and ship maneuverability rating. &nbsp;They look like this:</p>
<p>Attacker Modifier = attMod = random(half player level to player level)</p>
<p>Level Modifier = lvlMod = (Attacker Level &nbsp;- Defender Level) / 3</p>
<p>Ship MR Rating Modifier = mrMod = attMR - defMR</p>
<p>And these modifiers affect the launch % as follows:</p>
<p>PvP Drones Launched = [ (random(6 to 57) + attMod + lvlMod) / 1.5 ] &nbsp;+ (MRmod if number is negative)</p>
<p>Some notes on this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MRmod can only reduce drones launched. &nbsp;This is particularly painful for the ITMS which loses 3-7% of its drone launches even when firing on other capital ships.</li>
  <li>While this equation can generate negative numbers, the minimum launched is 0.</li>
  <li>Expected launches to average 25-35% in common, low level combat between similar ships.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Taking Damage from Forces, Ports, or Planets</h3>
<p>Strangely enough, maneuverability rating is not factored in to planet, port, or dropped force fire. &nbsp;This is likely because none of those environmental things have MR and the existing algorithms are designed around a MR delta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
