<h2>Hardpoint Weapons</h2>
<h3>Firing Weapons at Forces, Ports, or Planets</h3>
<h3>Firing Weapons at Ships</h3>
<h2>Combat Drones</h2>
<p>Combat drones always fire last. &nbsp;This is unfortunate for two reasons: drones deal rollover damage, which is more valuable up front. &nbsp;And it is easier to find hardpoint weapons that deal armor damage. &nbsp;But they are still a valuable damage source, even if the order is not optimal.</p>
<h3>Firing Drones at Forces, Ports, or Planets</h3>
<p>The algorithm that determines how many drones are launched is most simple when firing at environmental targets. &nbsp;That simplicity makes it a good place to start. &nbsp;It looks like this:</p>
<p>Drones Launched = random(6 to 57)</p>
<p>PvE Drone DPS = 63 per hundred Drones</p>
<p>The number of drones launched when attacking the environment is a percentage of the total alive on your ship. &nbsp;This is effectively a random number generated between 6% and 57%. &nbsp;On average, 31.5% of drones launch. &nbsp;They always hit. &nbsp;They always deal 2 damage. &nbsp;Given these facts, combat drones can be modeled as dealing 63 DPS per 100 drones alive at the time of firing. &nbsp;The variation is quite extreme, but eventually the law of large numbers will bring the average to 31.5%.</p>
<p>Now, a bit about where that 6-57% came from. &nbsp;A ship firing drones has, before modifiers, a 3% base accuracy. &nbsp;A random number is generated between 3 and 54. &nbsp;That random number is added to the base accuracy which gives us a minimum possible of 6 and a max possible of 57. &nbsp;Environmental targets have no offensive or defensive modifiers concerning combat drones. &nbsp;We press attack, we get somewhere between 6 and 57 percent launched, we deal between 12 and 114 damage per hundred drones. &nbsp;It's simple, boring damage.</p>

<h3>Firing Drones at Ships</h3>
<p>Players versus player combat is where drones get a little complicated.</p>
