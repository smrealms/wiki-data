<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The following is a collection of notes that I do not consider tested rigorously enough to publish as a matter of fact. This piece is born out of want for entertainment as much as to make information available. The intended audience is anyone with at least some game experience. &nbsp;It's going to be full of opinionated arguments and occasional jackassery. That said, it will all be rooted in observation of game mechanics and play.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank my children for making this possible. &nbsp;I would never find the time to do things like this if they existed. &nbsp;And I'd like to thank me for never making that mistake. &nbsp;I sincerely deserve a significant pay raise for such deft decision making under years of pressure from moronic authority figures. &nbsp;And I'd also like to thank the longest standing and wisest influence in my life. &nbsp;His book, an endless fountain of knowledge. &nbsp;His teachings, my bedrock. &nbsp;His love and sacrifice for humanity has truly saved us all. &nbsp;On behalf of people everywhere, thank you Red. &nbsp;Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati.</p>

<h1>Alignment Notes</h1>
<p>Deputizing as a green agent gives you access to the best mine clearing ships and an excellent anti-shield weapon. &nbsp;This is a big edge when attacking an enemy planet galaxy. &nbsp;And the HHG allows for much better armament for dealing with enemy ships.</p>
<p>Becoming a red smuggler gives you access to somewhat better trade routes and an excellent PR/PB weapon. &nbsp;Sometimes the illegal goods aren't worth much, sometimes they are a big advantage. &nbsp;And the Nuke deals unparalleled damage against fixed targets</p>
<p>In case this need be said: The FU and DC, at 1660 and 1500 hit points, are not suitable raiding vessels. &nbsp;If you use them to fire on ports and planets, you will be promptly returned to your racial HQ in an escape pod. &nbsp;It will be expensive. &nbsp;People will laugh. &nbsp;Those two ships are hunting vessels large enough to take out any ship in the game under the correct circumstances.</p>
<p>Either way you chose, you're going to gain access to the 2 best hunting ships in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green is stronger all around. A jump drive is much stronger than a cloak. Mine clearing is much cheaper than mine laying. Red is only stronger if you're going to be a pure trader.</p>
<p>And always remember, it's much easier to subtract alignment by shooting ports. Adding alignment is tricky.</p>
<h1>Game Play Notes</h1>
<h3>The Insurance Scam</h3>
<p>Insurance scams are profitable when humans have a port, banks, and access to CD's within a few sectors of fed. &nbsp;Or if you're Ik'Thorne and have a port and bank near fed. &nbsp;The procedure is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>buy 1 CD</li>
  <li>put all money in bank</li>
  <li>drop newbie protection</li>
  <li>fire at port</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time you die with 0 credits, you pocket an extra 100k. &nbsp;Of which, 95k goes in the bank. It's 10.5 deaths per million.</p>
<p>There's a break over point where it's more profitable to go trade. It's probably about 15 turns per death cycle and varies wildly with the map.</p>
<p>it is also possible, but slightly less profitable, with any race if certain weapon shops are near fed</p>
<p>Overall, this is very tedious to do but can generate a few million credits within an hour of a game opening. per player pulling the scam.</p>
<h3><br>Race Change Hijinks</h3>
<p>The racial change mechanic can be gamed. &nbsp;The help of an alliance is needed for it to be truly effective.</p>
<ol>
  <li>start as Alskant</li>
  <li>have your alliance share maps and give you funds to buy a trip maker</li>
  <li>go out and trade the highest profit routes you can find</li>
  <li>dump the profits back in to the AA</li>
  <li>before your 2 day timer is up, switch to a useful race</li>
</ol>
<p>This can kick start an alliance but it stunts the trader that does it. They lose their XP on the race change.</p>
<p>If you've got a big Alskant route, say 5x or better with mid tier or better goods, you can make a lot of cash doing this.</p>
<h3><br>Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>Ports can be force fed to upgrade. &nbsp;The process is to buy goods for 1,000 credits each. &nbsp;It's least annoying to do with a PSF buying cargo for 500,000 credits each time. &nbsp;Anything over 1k per good is not counted towards port upgrades UNLESS the port offers to sell the goods for more than that. (very high multiplier situation)</p>
<h1>Operation Notes</h1>
<p>Alliance warfare, ultimately, is a cultural war. &nbsp;Yes, there's strategy. &nbsp;There's tactics, number crunching, and raw talent which give outcome to individual events. &nbsp;But the overall war is won by growing and maintaining an active group.</p>
<p>The primary quality of an alliance who will gain and hold territory is player activity. &nbsp;It's above any measure of skill or wisdom. &nbsp;Not to say a savvy crew won't deploy a few overly effective tactics and have a few celebrated battles. &nbsp;But the more numerous, more active alliance will win the war. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The larger, more active group runs more ops, funds more miners, and keeps more people moving to where the fight is. &nbsp;There's very little contest. &nbsp;In a game of holding turf, he who can keep the cash flowing the longest, he who can put the most ships in sector, will gain ground.</p>
<p>You could probably write a dissertation in a PoliSci field on this game. &nbsp;People who play the game band together around common causes. &nbsp;You've got people staunchly in one camp or another. &nbsp;People are sometimes seen as heroes or villains. &nbsp; Echo chambers form around alliances. &nbsp;The human factor is wild.</p>
<h1>Racial Notes</h1>
<h3>Alskant</h3>
<p>This race has three powerful things. &nbsp;Strongest first:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Relations bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with +250 across the board means nobody can close their ports to you. &nbsp;This means, if you're careful, you can always access the weapons and ports of each race.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Trip-Maker</li>
</ul>
<p>A day 1 trader with 2820 trade power. &nbsp;This ship is excellent for getting out of the gate faster than other races. &nbsp;Which is an advantage you will be poised to hang on to</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Deep-Spacer</li>
</ul>
<p>A jump trader with 2400 power, 750 hit points, carries all 3 forces, and has 3 hard points. &nbsp;It's a versatile beast.</p>
<p>This is the strongest all around trade ship in the game. &nbsp;And it's very good for tending planets.</p>
<p><br>And they have one overwhelming disappointment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Trade-Master</li>
</ul>
<p>This ship, billed as a raider, is absolutely not a raider. &nbsp;1500 hit points, 155 DPS, 1800 trade power, and 675 mine power. It's a 6 of all trades. &nbsp;Not even a DCS will save it. &nbsp;250 turret damage means 1667 drones will kill it. L9 ports usually have that many drones for the first couple shots. &nbsp;The only way this ship survives is if all the turrets miss it. Which is not something anyone should rely on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its most effective function is planet tending. &nbsp;Using the ATM to haul drones around saves an ITMS from having to do it. &nbsp;The ITMS can then show up to an op to soak damage.</p>
<p>The Trade-Master mostly exists to shine a light on the absence of a neutral raiding ship. &nbsp;Neutral has the top hunting ships, traders that haul 90% of what Skant traders do, decent miners, decent drone haulers, and not a single raiding ship.</p>
<p><br>Alskant are a good choice for solo play. This way a player reaps their trading and relations benefits but does not lose out on operations. &nbsp;Outside of that, you're better off picking a different race and getting access to a real raider.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creonti</h3>
<p>Nobody ever regrets playing Creo.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Devastator</li>
</ul>
<p>All hail the Devastator. &nbsp;Seriously. It's the best op ship. If you are raiding a port, busting a planet, or in fleet combat you want to fly a dev.</p>
<p>It's cheap to buy. It's cheap to repair. &nbsp;The 300 shields give it excellent survivability against planets. 2 turret strikes and 1799 drones? no problem!</p>
<p>The only time it's a liability is if somebody stops and swaps their guns to a HHG + all armor weapons. That's the only way another non-dev is a threat to a dev.</p>
<p>The dev recently lost a hardpoint in the name of balance. &nbsp;That's OK. &nbsp;8 guns, 7 guns, 6 guns, it doesn't matter. I'd still happily bring this to an op with 5 hard points.</p>
<p>The low speed is also negligible. This ship keeps people alive in a game where death costs are severe. Operations revolve around the pace this beast sets.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Leviathan</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the strongest non Alskant trade ship. &nbsp;1680 trade power. 800 hit points. scouts and mines. &nbsp;Cheap, safe, and effective. &nbsp; (Note to self: condom joke here)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong><u>CBD</u></strong> is a 2.5% damage boost over BMTL. This does not translate well to mines because it's 10 damage out of sync.</p>
<p>The <strong><u>Shield Sucker</u></strong> is a decent stopgap weapon if you can't get Thevian or Nijarin peace. HHG+CSS+ASD is 246 shield DPS with a reasonable mix of chip and burst.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why the strongest combat race is the also 2nd strongest trade race and has solid weapons I don't know. But why fight the system when you can roll with it? Play Creo.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Human</h3>
<p>A mining race with a poor mans Fed Ult.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Border Cruiser</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, how I love mines. They're the most obnoxious game mechanic. Absurdly expensive to deploy. Simple, but incredibly slow and annoying to remove.</p>
<p>They shut down trade routes. They absolutely consume newbie turns. They make buying weapons outright infuriating.</p>
<p>They're such an imposing game mechanic that CA placement is one of the chief considerations when you're designing a map. &nbsp;Seriously. You have to place them with respect to surrounding uno access, max force time on galaxies, distance from racial/federal space, and maybe a more depending on the map.</p>
<p>And did I mention how incredibly expensive they are? A HBC might drop 20-30M worth of mines each day.</p>
<p>The whole concept is absurd. And useful. Because they are ultimately what holds turf. They keep the ports and planets of your alliance safe.</p>
<p>1200 mining power. And a jump drive for a 20% efficiency increase on those long trips. The HBC stands above all else when hauling mines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Destroyer</li>
</ul>
<p>The damage output is quite good; alongside a DC at roughly 299 DPS. And jump tech is probably the best tech all around.</p>
<p>It's flimsy because it's only got 1800 hit points. Well, 1850 with the current tweak in place.</p>
<p>And it's flimsy because it's about 40% shields. Which is close to where people commonly balance their weapons because they look at the shield/armor damage on the display which has no regard for accuracy. That and good shield weapons are unicorns in this game.</p>
<p>The FU is highly regarded where the destroyer is mildly despised because</p>
<ul>
  <li>additional speed and firepower, plus having scouts, make the FU a great hunting ship</li>
  <li>going down to 1660 hit points and a monumental increase in cost clear up any confusion in the ship list - the FU is not a raiding vessel</li>
  <li>the federal 1/2 force damage multiplier helps survivability and gives the FU a clear op niche as a mine clearer</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You play Human to drop tens of thousands of mines. The trade ships are crap. They have one solid weapon, the HPT, and the rest are garbage. The raider is lackluster. It's all about the mines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ik'Thorne</h3>
<p>Planet stockers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Mother Ship</li>
</ul>
<p>The ITMS crossed the road without shields. It hit 3 mines. /13 became a pod. Everyone laughed as 2M credits in drones couldn't stop 60 damage.</p>
<p>Best to avoid ship to ship combat with this thing. MR penalties to drones are steep. And combat drones die half way through a fight which makes it hard to take out the enemy vessel.</p>
<p>There is one place where the MS is very powerful. Defending a planet bust.</p>
<p>As the attackers shoot the planets, the MS can top the drones off. This empties the drones off the MS and will double or triple the pods the attacker has to eat.</p>
<p>When the planet gets low on drones, the MS can pull 400 drones off the planet. This causes the players to spill off much earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Other ships can do this but nothing does it like a MS can.</p>
<p>And there's one other spot where the MS usually performs well: fleet combat.</p>
<p>Drone damage is concentrated, does not care what it hits, and rolls over when the shield breaks. &nbsp;Plus 2250 hit points to pod is a good thing to have when there's 10 ships firing at you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ik'Thorne race is an interesting concept turned in to drone ferries by game mechanics. It's incredibly frustrating to watch and even more so to play. Every alliance needs one or two of these to move drones about. Beyond that, they are expensive and inefficient ships to have around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nijarin</h3>
<p>Best guns you can get.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>These things have a great mentality. If their shields are up, hit them hard. If their shields are down, chip the armor.</p>
<p>This is a great mentality to mix with neutral weapons who collectively think "WE MUST DESTROY ONLY ARMOR!"</p>
<p>Or to not be mixed at all. You can load a ship up with only Nijarin weapons and perform very well under most circumstances.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Fury</li>
</ul>
<p>This ship is probably the most efficient way to extract cash from ports. &nbsp;It's just tough enough to take down level 9 ports safely. Plus it's reasonably fast and has good firepower.</p>
<p>1575 hit points plus a DCS means it takes 2100 drones to kill it outright. &nbsp;But then we run in to the nemesis of the DCS - normal weapons fire. And I call it normal because it's everywhere.</p>
<p>1 planet or 2 port turrets, which commonly hit a ship in an op, bring that down to 1767 drones to death. Probably fine for a port, sketchy for a planet. &nbsp;A second planetary turret brings that down to 1434 drones to death. Hello Nijarin beacon!</p>
<p>Environmental survivability is similar to an EoS or TAC. They're beefier than the small raiders but they die routinely to large ports or planets.</p>
<p>in PvP combat this ship is flimsy. The only thing giving it a chance is a high shield ratio, 55.5%, which will keep it standing longer than it otherwise would.</p>
<p>One other noteworthy thing, the DCS provides a damage AND turn cost bonus to clearing forces. This thing is second only to a FU when it comes to clearing mines.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play Nij to beat the environment. &nbsp;Forces, ports, planets. &nbsp;They are also one of the best races to go evil with. &nbsp;Their hunters are interesting but neutral hunters always have you covered. &nbsp;Their trader is not worth buying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Salvene</h3>
<p>It's an illusion! Designed explicitly to get italic players killed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Eater of Souls</li>
</ul>
<p>1050 shields! That's the headline.</p>
<p>Remember, earlier in this rambling mess, I mentioned people tend to balance their weapons around 40% shield DPS? &nbsp;That's going to put shield damage per shot around 200. Which means 5 or 6 shots go by before the EoS shields break. See the problem?</p>
<p>An invading op is targeting forces made of 100% armor. &nbsp;They do not want to deal with ships that have 1050 shields while clearing mines. &nbsp;Add in some mines for seeding and you've got yourself the strongest defensive ship around.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the high shield ratio strongly contrasts the much more dangerous devastators. They make a good team as it penalized people for weighting their guns too far in to armor or shields.</p>
<p>The EoS can be frustrating though. The ship usually feels very tough. But sometimes people land good shield hits. And sometimes you take a good hit in an op and it's only 2000 hit points. &nbsp;Things go sideways quickly.</p>
<p>The IG provides one advantage against anyone who knows better. It's an extra mental load to track how injured an EoS is. You can't just look at the /3. You have to scan the damn thing if you don't remember. Which isn't much of a bonus. But I do believe it helps. Definitely so when fighting in front on an uno.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Drudge</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a beefy MV with a slight ding to trade power</p>
<p>I prefer a MV because trading without scouts is dangerous. &nbsp;But the drudge is accessible.</p>
<p>I don't buy the IG if money is short. They can see your XP moving. They know you're trading. &nbsp;IG tech on a trade ship is just for laughs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of people who played back when prize the <strong><u>SEMFC</u></strong>. &nbsp;It's not a good weapon. &nbsp;The damage is too impure, too balanced. &nbsp;I don't know why we sought after it so much. &nbsp;It just became popular.</p>
<p>The <strong><u>Flux Resonator</u></strong> and <strong><u>Frag Missile</u></strong> are, on the other hand, overlooked gems. &nbsp;People tend to overlook the value of chip damage. When you've got a HHG firing at 35%, what happens when you're shooting something with 50 shields left? All your other guns wait on that hit to cycle back around. &nbsp;Not to mention the ++ versions of these weapons deal more DPS than pure P4 weapons.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salvene are a decent all around race. They're best chosen if your alliance is defending territory. Pair them with humans and watch your attackers hate life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
