<!-- SUBTITLE: SMR Administration -->

There are several ways to contact the admins of SMR.
1. **In-game Personal Message**: You can message an admin in-game. When they are online, you will see them with a blue Admin tag attached to their name on the Current Players list. An example of an admin player would be `Lieutenant 2nd Class Hot MaMa (14) Admin`.
2. **In-game Contact Form**: You will find the contact form in-game on the left side of the page. This links to a page with a form, which you can fill out and submit. Your submission will be automatically sent to support@smrealms.de.
3. **On IRC**: By joining #smr through the IRC link in-game or [here](https://client02.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.theairlock.net&channel=%23smr), you can message any admin who is in chat via a personal message by clicking their name. Admins will have a ~, & or @ in front of their chat nicknames.
4. **On the forums**: Once you create an account on the [web board forums](https://smrcnn.smrealms.de/), you can send a personal message to admins. Their names are colored in red so that they can be easily distinguished. Click on one of their names and either PM or email them.
5. **On Discord**: You can join the public SMR Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/8sZartg). In the list of players on the right side of the page, admins will be listed under "Game Admin".
